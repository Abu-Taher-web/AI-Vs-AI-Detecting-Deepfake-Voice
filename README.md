## Description
This project, part of my ‘Affective Computing’ course, aims to detect deepfake voices using advanced machine learning models. The project uses LSTM, CRNN, and FRNN models to accurately classify voices as either real or AI-generated. Deepfake voice technology has potential malicious applications, such as impersonating individuals for crimes like bank scams or spreading fake news. This system aims to prevent such harmful activities by identifying deepfake voices.

## Installation
All the code for this project is in the `ai-vs-ai-detecting-deepfake-voices (3).ipynb` file. 
- All required packages are listed within the notebook. 
- To install missing packages, use the command: 
    ```bash
    pip install <package_name>
    ```
I developed this project in a Kaggle environment, so make sure to use that for smooth execution. Upload this file to your account and connect it to the dataset. 

### Dataset
The dataset for this project is available at:  
[Deepfake Voice Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birdy654/deep-voice-deepfake-voice-recognition/data)

- The dataset contains audio files: 56 fake voice files and 8 real audio voice files.
- Upload this file to your account and connect it to the dataset. 

### Running the Code
1. Upload the code into your account and connect it to the dataset.
2. Connect the code file to the dataset.
3. Run the provided Jupyter notebook (`ai-vs-ai-detecting-deepfake-voices (3).ipynb`).
4. Each section in the notebook is commented for clarity. Follow the comments to understand each step.
5. The training and testing procedures follow standard practices for machine learning models.

## Usage
The notebook is structured with clear comments to guide you through the process:
- **Training**: Training the model with the provided dataset.
- **Testing**: Standard testing procedure to evaluate the model's performance.
- **Inference**: Using the trained model to identify deepfake voices from new audio inputs.

## Features
- **Voice Detection**: Identifies AI-generated deepfake voices with high accuracy.
- **Model Flexibility**: The system can be enhanced by integrating different models or improving hyperparameters.

## Contributing
You are welcome to improve this project! You can experiment with other machine learning models to enhance the accuracy or add additional features.
